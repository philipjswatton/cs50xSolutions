# cs50_solutions
This repositories contains my solutions for the CS50 problem sets.

I originally started CS50 in 2020 but was sidetracked by uni work and poor habits re sticking to a single course. Hence the first two problem sets were completed in 2020. I'm hoping to do a better job of staying on top of it this year. I'm making this repository public mainly to pubically commit to finishing CS50!

Naturally much of the code within comes from the CS50 team who wrote it for the tasksets.
